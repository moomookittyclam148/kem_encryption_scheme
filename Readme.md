#KEM Encryption scheme

- In this assignment we were asked to build a public key cryptosystem using a key encapsulation mechanism. The idea is that by using a hybrid encryption scheme (combining an asymmetric and symmetric system), we can produce a highly efficient public-key system, thus getting the best of both worlds.
